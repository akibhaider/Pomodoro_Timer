Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer App! This application is designed to enhance productivity by implementing the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that promotes focused work sessions interspersed with short breaks.

## Features

- **Pause Anytime**: Start or pause your work session with a simple click and halt the timer at any moment if you need to step away.
- **Auto-Activation**: The timer automatically starts the next session, ensuring smooth transitions between work and break periods.
- **Short Breaks**: After each work session, enjoy a short break to recharge.
- **Long Breaks**: Take a longer break after a set number of work sessions to maintain productivity.
- **Timer Switching**: Easily switch between work and break timers to adapt to your workflow. 

## How to Use

1. **Start/Pause**: Click the play/pause button to begin your work session. The timer will automatically start a break period once the work session ends.
2. **Short Breaks**: After each work session, a short break is automatically activated to give you a quick rest.
3. **Long Breaks**: After completing a set number of work sessions (usually 4), a long break is activated to help you relax more thoroughly.
